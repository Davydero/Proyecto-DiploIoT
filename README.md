<h1> HOME WATER FLOW MONITORING SYSTEM BASED ON IOT </h1>
<p>
This repository contains the description and scripts implemented for the development of a prototype device for monitoring water flow based on the Internet of things. The system prototype has two main elements, a GATEWAY NODE and a SENSOR NODE. The GATEWAY NODE is in charge of collecting the information from the SENSOR NODES and through its Ethernet port it is in charge of sending the information through the MQTT protocol to a defined broker. It also proposes the implementation of a basic web interface that serves to visualize the status of the sensors, display an alarm in case of a leak in the water network and be able to remotely control the actuators of the network.
